___
result session:
My story:
- JC OGL
- Church
- 

My aspirations:
- Career -> Learning, Money, Change Agent, Problem solving
    this will hold true for any industry, any work, any form of employment (employee/ entrepreneur)
    maybe not every life season
- Life -> valued relationship, meaningful work (rather than "freedom" but unlimited leisure time) (also, at least can get leader's heart, then ok to do lame work), successful = valued by others
- Life stage, theme -> Validation vs Rejection (learn how to build resilience with Rejection)
- Words of advice -> anchor to core values rather than industry or job, hold labels with a loose hand, rejection as a person vs reject
- Observations -> working in silo, agree with path to be employed
