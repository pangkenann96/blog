"Be your own agency" -> 4W.EJ

Takeaway:
- That which I learn from any organisation/ entity/ etc, I learn to apply to my work-style. Take macro an turn into micro. 
    - Corporation budgets finances? I budget finances
    - Team uses scrum for iterative projects? My personal relationships uses scrum for iterative managing
    - Company uses systems and algorithms for efficiency? I use systems and algorithms to do what 10 people can do, by myself, each day. 
- Confidence. Mind of my own. I do not rely on nor am stunted by the thinking of the leadership. If I see things (namely problems), I will think of ways to overcome it, whether or not leadeship acknowledges them. (Just apply tact, EQ, resources management, timing, etc. Basically apply discernment) I am perfectly fine with having divergent thoughts (thoughts, not action or alignment) with the leadership. Independence of thoughts, that I may one day demystify false long-held-beliefs-seen-as-truths, to solve persistent, recurring problems that has large negative impact, though completely avoidable, with simple - but not neccesarily easy - change in approach (ie. gross inefficiencies.)
- Flywheel of capabilities/ mental models.
