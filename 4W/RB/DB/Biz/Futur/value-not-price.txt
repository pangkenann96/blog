youtube. 30min. most watched on channel. 

when customer. mom and pop vs mega corporation.
risk not revenue. (I would revenue lol)
    - convince the mark you are safe, not you are great
        perhaps... this is how it's done
        if the world is largely risk averse,
        then you be risk taking
        and sell to their risk aversion.
        rather than convince them to be risk taking
        and then you have no customers.
        hm...
(ah.. risk taking appetite of Them, not me)
price the client, not the work
client has risk, factored into work, factored into price
    -> higher risk = higher price [y]
        - cost of operation
        - if not good, semula
        - "how many boxes are you gonna put your product on?.."
        - "what if you get backlash from public?.."
        - "yes, you could hire a bunch of interns. for afew hundred bucks
        Then they do the work. But it's not to your idea. 
        But they don't get your idea. Then you go find another group...
        That's time. 
        And btw, mark, shouldn't you be spending time on your business?
        What the cost of that?"
    -> take more time = higher price [n]
- Questions vs statements
    "If I said it, you may not believe me. If you said it..."
- anchor to impact by revenue
- * Questions -> build ammunition -> more questions (anchor to symmetry of logic) -> shift mark's stance
- * Get to position by fixed rate and/or share upside,
    then hire out the work. where work must be right
    pay away the risk
