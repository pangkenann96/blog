Want to increase efficiency
Starts with me

Steps 
Observe my work
Find repetitive, manual tasks
Find ways to automate away
If I can write a software program for that, do that
Low tech to high tech slider (low tech eg google sheets. That’s fine. No shame. High tech proper programming languages)
Low tech very fast to build. May lack sophistication and customizability. But it’s fast. 
Good for prototyping. Good for sharing with colleagues for them to use without dependencies or learning curves.
High tech can be slow to build. If lack knowledge on program language, need to learn. Takes time. Then practice, takes time. Then cobble a working project. Takes time. Then refactor and maintain the program. Time, time, time. But end product can be very powerful and scaleable. 
Potential to solve a painful, laborious, time-eating task for thousands of our panda heroes -> increase efficiency of workforce at scale, without much cost (since I’m creating on open source programming languages) => low cost efficiency boost. 
If really so good, potential even to become a microservice to our customers, or B2B other companies with similar problems their employees face -> increase revenue.

Bottomline: potential to increase foodpanda’s cashflow position.
If I can find a service for that, look into it as well
Saas services (likely to bump into paywall). Slider between free and paid
Open source code -> Github (beware of voodoo code. Also malicious code)
Community sharing -> reddit/ quora/ stackoverflow. (If other people have faced this problem, I may go research about it to see if any have already solved it. Then simply import their solution over and test if it works for our situation.
Expert sharing. (similar to Saas, except this is EaaS - expertise as a service). Slider between cheap and paid
(Yea, we already doing that. We brought in consultants right? In our town halls and what not. So Foodpadda has incorporated this. Maybe I can leverage it and expand the acquired expertise/ perspective from the speakers…)
(Right now, I have Malcolm, ngee ann poly lecturer - cofounder of a tech consultancy still running. Good network to tap on for future consults on basis of teacher-student relationship, goodwill.) 




Key action:
[ ] Turn the above information into a flowchart. A decision chart. BYOA.
[ ] Apply proc model on problem statements. Choose 1 project to start on.
	Database of problem statements (node js + mongodb? asked chek wee. next is Nazrene) -> filter criteria -> shortlist -> apply decision chart -> begin with scrum iterations until success
