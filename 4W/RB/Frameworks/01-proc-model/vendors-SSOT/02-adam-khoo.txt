1. condense information by 80-20
    - Most explanation paragraphs actually bear no meaning.
    They do not aid in understanding
    Much is filler
    Our job is to find the keywords that do have meaning
    Then filter them out
    Leaving the rest out
    And we find that it tends to follow the 80-20 principle
    Where 80 percent of the text bears no meaning
    and 20 percent contains all the information
    -> Let's try the exercise

    - []

    move 1:
        - use ML to 80-20
            - tensorflow
        -[discover]-> transformers (google event AI ML) 
            -[discover]-> automatic summarizer
