Chapter 2: teams
[pg 38]
- female MBA team feel on eggshells. Keep to themselves. CCA team feel belonging. Contribution.
    "...group in yale... felt draining because the norms - the tussles over leadership, the pressure to constantly demonstrate expertise, the tendency to critique - had put her on guard. In contrast, the norms of her case competition team-enthusiasm for one another's ideas, withholding criticisms, encouraging people to take leadership role or hang back as they wanted- allowed everyone to be friendly (accepted) and unconstrained. Coordination was easy."

        Power of teams. Not just leadership.

        - extroversion all same vs blend? not-conclusive
        - personality/ hobbies/ experience/ race/ gender similar vs diverse? not-conclusive
        - collaborative vs healthy rivalry? not-conclusive
        - hierachal vs flat structure? not-conclusive
        - strangers at start vs friends before this? not-conclusive

        "No matter how they arranged the data... it was almost impossible to find patterns... The 'who' part of the equation didn't seem to matter"
        "Most confounding... sometimes two teams would have nearly identical compositions... but radically different levels of effectiveness"
    "...often, inside a group, there's a set of norms that override (personal) preferences and encourage deference to the team."
        Group norms powerful force in teams
        "When a team comes to an unspoken consensus...that's a norm asserting itself."
    "Data... finally... make sense... We had to manage the 'how' of teams, not the 'who' "

        - Strong teams have higher absolute error reportings. seems bad. but they don't lie. they don't cover up. they don't withhold information. 
            - Higher bugs reported is indication of open, trusting, and hence performing team, NOT incompetency. Counter-intuitive.
    "Have established a climate of openness that faciliate discussion of error, which is likely to be an important influence on detected error rates" - The journal of applied behavioural science 1996, Edmondson
        - leader sets the culture whether punitive or nonpunitive environment -> affects openness on errors and mistakes
