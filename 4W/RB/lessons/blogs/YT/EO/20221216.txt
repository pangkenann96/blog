"What it takes to raise $5.5M from nothing | Business Canvas team documentary"

- "If I want to impact a life, I will study very hard, become a doctor, and help people 1 at a time. But there are many, many more smarter, much smarter people than me who can do that. To impact more lives, I could instead create an environment that attracts these smart doctors and serve a large number of people."
- "A startup is a Problem Solving Organisation. Not a product-making organisation. Not a business organisation. Those will be later on... Verify that a problem is true."
-"...spoke to ... VC every single day for a year... progress we made each day..."

My takeaway:
- very different mindset from layman
- humble
- relatable
- bold



Note:
- How I wish I could watch a youtube video, "raise my hand" at periods that matter to me to highlight, and a "newspaper" is auto generated from it immedaitely after the video is done. -> 4W.RB.Condense
