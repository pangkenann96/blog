problem statement:
    - currently a foodpanda software engineer trainee
    - goal: to learn in 6 months what CS uni students learn in 4 years
        - goal behind goal: see how much a human can compress learning
    - situation: neccesitated by time constraint x lack of intuition to accelerate learning

proposed solution: systemise learning process (algorithmise approach, iterate the model as we go)

iteration cycles:
1.0 (Naive approach)
    1. just do it, make code that works
    2. "Bugs? nah, that won't happen to me... right?"
1.1 (case study: 10hr coding session on 1 exercise)
    - "... yea, no. Bugs. You'll face them. many, many, many of them." -> "aw, damn."
    - personal realisation: "how am I overcoming my bugs? how many hours of banging my head on the wall do I want? How come others just 'get it,' and I'm still struggling? find the reason and iterate. need an algo for when your code repeatedly fails. Some fallback mechanism." 
        - "Insanity is doing the same thing over expecting a different result" - albert einstein
        - "... I was probably insane."
    Method:
    1. meet a bug
    2. google the error message
    3. click the first 3 links recommended by google
    4. voodoo code? black magic code? nvm, just copy
    5. If it work, it works. Move on (don't worry about the problems down the road. lol)

    New method:

dang. did not log time of above. estimate around Nov 2022..

Obs: faced the same issue above time and time again. No fun. How long more? Vital to take a good look into it.
